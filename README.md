# Movie-Project
This is Project 1 for CPT281-H190
Code written by Samuel Maynard, Shane Callaway, and Dalton Vining
This program reads movies and related info from a txt file, adding them to one of two linked lists based on an enum parameter
The program can then perform certain actions related to the movies, such as editing info on a movie object, or printing out all moveis after a given release date
The program can also save any changes made to any of the movie objects, overwriting the original txt file and saving the changes
